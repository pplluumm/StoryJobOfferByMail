Chapter 1

One day, I received a job offer in the mail.

I mean who uses mail anymore?

***

Frankly, I just forgot about the letter. It was job offer to play a fantasy role playing game. Not might type of game. It smelled like one of those fancy fragrented envelope with gold plating. I didn't know it at the time but.. that was real gold plating.

Anyway, I just left the letter lying opened next to my computer at home.

Sigh, I had just finished my final exams Machine Learning, Database Systems, and Computer Networking all at the same time. Who am I kidding, it was spreadout throughtout the week. But the anticipation was killing me all week long.

I should be working on my capstone or looking for an internship in preparation for after graduation. Just two more quarters. I never knew that I would want to stay at college. But times do change.

Speaking of change I still have this spam job offer about playing a game and my brain is still caput so I can't play league. Time to try something new.

Inside the envelope I found a nice graphic of the game with a short description, a job offer, and a list of the hours I spent playing games on steam. O boy, how'd they get that. Isn't that a little far for a job offer. Am I being stalked?

Formalities aside, I created an account with my throw away email. This seems to be a beta version, so I have to put in the beta code that came in that fancy smancy envelope and log on.

It's taking a while, but this relaxing. I mean what are the chances I'd actually play this lol.

I finally start the game. Yes, it's connected to my steam account. The startup looks like SAO. Shivers. 

We get past the login and.. You know how they have that empty room in street fighter, well.

This is an RPG, why am I even here!?

This is the isolation box, where you will pick your combat style. ~navi

It was a rhetorical question! Wait, wait... Oh no, this is horrible. It's Navi. I scream and run upstairs. I peak twoard my computer, the rest of my sibling are staring at me like a crazy person. Uh, one of them is yawning. Welp, back to the game.

tbh I am a little crazy...


Chapter 2

~Le Princess on a casual ride

I yawned, one day your just riding peacefully through the bog of doom at the beheast of uncle, and the next thing you know is your shoes have been dirtied by a bunch of kidnapping undead. Hopefully they provide better entertainment, as payment for interupting my dreary ride.

I waved the customary screaming, it was tiring to say the least also being expected to be weak well there was no knight in shining armor about so I let myself off the hook, so to speak. The undead though, where most uncivilzed, they tried to put an iron collar on myself. Outragious, I had to show them the proper order of things. 

"Ara," I snapped my fingers.
"Yes Princess," my slave trembled.

I gestured for her to take my place. I mean really, these minions where so unprofessional one does not simply put a chain on a princess. After all I do control how much my ransom is. I let out a sly smile as I think about docking 100 gold from my kidnappers. Have to teach the new ones proper restraint, who knows what might happen.

I swipe the chain out of the undead's hand as we start walking further into the bog. I've always wanted to know how it felt to pull a slave along like this. But my pa, you know the king, always blabs about the good of the people. But sometimes I spy uncle's people doing it. This would be a good experiance, my pa always told me it's good to gain experiance. But really it's just an excuse, what he really should be doing is spending more time with me. I let a little pout appear on my face. O the pain of being a princess.

The troupe of undead with the "captured" princess wander into the distance.
