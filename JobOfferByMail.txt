It started one day, by a job offer from mail.

No one uses mail anymore. I carefully look around. So you could see my surprise when I actually received one for me. The cover was glossy, blah, blah. Just imagine a really impressive email, accept on paper.

I kept the letter as I gave gran the mail.

"Ooo, brat's got mail."

I nod staring absently at my phone. "Oh, don't be like that." Granny grabs my non-phone hand and drags me next to the wall of filing cabnets... Their's one with my name on it.

"Come one let, granny take a picture."

Two Flies miander out as I open, emphasizing how empty my cabnite is.

"Ah, flies. Mandy have you been leaving food again." Mandy is gran's imaginarry friend. 

I put the letter in and start walking away.

"Brat, aren't you forgetting something? You need to wright a thank you card." I dart away, but grans to fast. I'm jerked back.

Defeated I walk away with the torture devices pen and paper.

Wack. A newspaper roll hits me on the head. "Don't give me that."

I straighten up. Wack.

I turn slowly and STARE at granny.

Gran's smiling like a little girl, "That is for thinking that no one uses mail anymore."

Then she whispers, "I know everything." She wiggles her eyebrows as the forth wall breaks.

Really though, gran and I have a good relationship. Gramps is dead and all the children have moved away. I'm the only grandchild to keep her company. I just make it difficult for her to give her a reason to live, old people need a reason to live. And I'm that reason, or at least that is what I tell myself.

Although I call him brat, Little Muppet's always been caring. Like breakfast in bed, chores, and fetching the mail when I'm told cold to mosey along.

Part of it is I beat the love of God into him. The other part is the withered flower wanting to bloom after he lost his family family.

Heaven knows, that I'm hardly qualified, what with no man for the brat to look up to. But my children are to busy with their live for him. To busy for me either. Left alone to rot in the corner.

I'll do my best even if it means the Love of God and Hell Fire.

I suddenly feel a shiver go up my back. Something is not right with the world.
