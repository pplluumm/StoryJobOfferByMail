Chapter 1

~MudPie

One day, I received a job offer in the mail.

I mean who uses mail anymore?

***

Frankly, I just forgot about the letter. It was job offer to play a fantasy role playing game. Not might type of game. It smelled like one of those fancy fragrented envelope with gold plating. I didn't know it at the time but.. that was real gold plating.

Anyway, I just left the letter lying opened next to my computer at home.

Sigh, I had just finished my final exams Machine Learning, Database Systems, and Computer Networking all at the same time. Who am I kidding, it was spreadout throughtout the week. But the anticipation was killing me all week long.

I should be working on my capstone or looking for an internship in preparation for after graduation. Just two more quarters. I never knew that I would want to stay at college. But times do change.

Speaking of change I still have this spam job offer about playing a game and my brain is still caput so I can't play league. Time to try something new.

Inside the envelope I found a nice graphic of the game with a short description, a job offer, and a list of the hours I spent playing games on steam. O boy, how'd they get that. Isn't that a little far for a job offer. Am I being stalked?

Formalities aside, I created an account with my throw away email. This seems to be a beta version, so I have to put in the beta code that came in that fancy smancy envelope and log on.

It's taking a while, but this relaxing. I mean what are the chances I'd actually play this lol.

I finally start the game. Yes, it's connected to my steam account. The startup looks like SAO. Shivers. 

We get past the login and.. You know how they have that empty room in street fighter, well.

This is an RPG, why am I even here!?

This is the isolation box, where you will pick your combat style. ~navi

It was a rhetorical question! Wait, wait... Oh no, this is horrible. It's Navi. I scream and run upstairs for a little bit. I peak downstairs, the rest of my sibling are staring at me like a crazy person. One of them is yawning. Welp, back to the game.

tbh I am a little crazy...


Chapter 2

~Le Princess on a casual ride

I yawned, one day your just riding through the bog of doom and you get jumped by a bunch of kidnapping undead. Hopefully they would provide better entertainment.

I waved the customary screaming, I was to tiring when there was no one knight in shining armor about. I did have to direct the undead from puting the iron collar on my righteous self. "Ara," I snapped my fingers.

Trembling my slave approached me. I gestured for her to take my place. I mean really, these minions where so unprofessional. Although I guess it is to be expected since they are brainless corpses. But still, the necromancer could control them better. After I control how much my ransom is.

I swipe the chain as we start wandering further into the bog. Always wanted to see how it felt to be pull a slave along like this. But my pa, you know the king, always blabs about the good of the people. Ha, what about my good. After all he always says we should have many experiances or something like that. Really he should spend more time with me. I pout a little.

The troupe of the "captured" princess travers into the distance.
